Assignment-Implement a function to reverse a string (a list of characters), in place.

I am using java version "1.8.0_251".

To run the program type following commands in Commend Prompt

javac StringReverse.java

java StringReverse


We are taking input as String and convert it to Character Array Because
String is mutable so it's better to convert it into character array then proceed for reverse.
